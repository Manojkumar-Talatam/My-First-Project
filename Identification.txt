Scan Type: SYN Scan (nmap -sS)

Live Hosts Detected: 4

Total Time Taken: ~108.74 seconds 
IP address,Open Ports and Identified Potential Risks:

1. Host: 192.168.29.1

Hostname: reliance.reliance
MAC Address: AB:88:F1:24:08:C8 (Servercom India Private Limited)

Open Ports:

80/tcp – HTTP

443/tcp – HTTPS

7493/tcp – HTTPS

7469/tcp – iSCSI

2489/tcp – Oracle HTTPS

20602/tcp – Teradata ORDBMS

8082/tcp – HTTP Proxy

8200/tcp – Closed (Trinvet)

8443/tcp – HTTPS-Alt


Potential Risks:

Unsecured HTTP traffic (port 80) may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.

HTTPS ports (443, 7493, 8443) must use strong SSL/TLS configurations to prevent downgrade or certificate attacks.

iSCSI (7469) and database ports (2489, 20602) can expose sensitive data if not properly secured.

HTTP Proxy (8082) can be abused for tunneling or anonymized attacks if misconfigured.


2. Host: 192.168.29.26

MAC Address: D2:56:46:CC:4E:83 (Unknown)

Open/Filtered Port:
